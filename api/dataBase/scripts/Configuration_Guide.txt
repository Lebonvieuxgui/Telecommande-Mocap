##### Unreal :

For the script triggering the recording to work, you will have to perform those few steps:

- First, go to the Plugins Manager, Enable "Remote Control API", and restart Unreal.

- Add these lines at the end of DefaultEngine.ini (usually located at "Documents/Unreal Projects/<Name of your project>/Config") :
	[HTTPServer.Listeners]
	DefaultBindAddress= <IP Address of your computer>
  and restart Unreal.

- Then, you need to add a new C++ class to your Unreal project (MyTakeRecorderController.cpp).
	• Click on File->'New C++ Class'
	• Select the 'Actor' Parent Class
	• Type name "MyTakeRecorderController" (otherwise you will need to modify the script and put your classname in the objectPath field of the request's payload)
	• Create Class
	• Copy/Paste the content of MyTakeRecorderController.h and MyTakeRecorderController.cpp in your class header and source files
	  /!\ In the header file, you will need to replace "FACEARSAMPLE" with your project's name
	• In the file <Name-of-your-project>.Build.cs, add "TakeRecorder", "TakesCore" and "LevelSequence" at the end of PublicDependencyModuleNames.
	• Then, build the solution, and it's over !
	• You might need to restart Unreal to have it detect your new class.

- Normally this step is done on its own, but just in case you can manually activate the remote control server: 
  Go to 'Window' -> 'Developer Tools' -> 'Output log' and enter the command "WebControl.StartServer"

- Open the Take Recorder Panel and make sure the Take Recorder has a Source to record !

- Finally, in the Raspberry's web app "Solidremote" (http://192.168.1.200:3000), replace Start/Stop Command Line Arguments of the script "Unreal" with:
   • ip : IP address of your computer
   • port : HTTP Server Port of Unreal (Default : 30010, otherwise look at 'Project Settings'->'Web Remote Control')
   • projectname : the name of your project

If it does not work, first check the Output Log.
You can also try to deactivate your computer's firewall on your private network.


##### LiveLinkFace :

In the LiveLinkFace apps, go to Settings->OSC and enable OSC. You will also find your device's IP Address and OSC Port (8000 by default).
Make sure all your devices using LiveLinkFace use the same OSC Port number.

In the Raspberry web app "Solidremote" (http://192.168.1.200:3000), replace Start/Stop Command Line Arguments of the script "LiveLinkFace" with:
   • ip : your devices' IP addresses, separated with '/' (for example : --ip="192.168.1.197 / 192.168.1.163")
   • port : the OSC port number (Default : 8000)


##### Motionbuilder :

Not much to do here, you just have to make sure there is something to record by putting a device into the scene and check hits box "Recording".
If recording is not launched, it is probably because of a race condition : in this case, try a bigger sleeping time between sent commands in the "launch" function of the script.

In the Raspberry web app "Solidremote" (http://192.168.1.200:3000), replace Start/Stop Command Line Arguments of the script "Motionbuilder" with:
   • ip : IP address of your computer
   • port : Motionbuilder Telnet port number (Default : 4242)
